# Vehicle Management System
Project Grade 12 Computer Science / Informatics Practices


💻 Using Python as the frontend and MySQL as the backend is a powerful combination that can create dynamic and efficient applications.

👨‍💻 The ```main.py``` program is the heart of the project, like the captain of the ship 🚢, while ```admin.py``` and ```cust.py``` are like supporting actors that play important roles. These two programs are imported into ```main.py``` to make the whole project run smoothly, like gears in a machine 🤖.

💼 ```admin.py``` is like the manager of the project, with the ability to insert, update, and delete values in the MySQL database using Python. It has all the power to make changes and keep the database organized and up to date, like a superhero 🦸‍♂️.

🧑‍💼 ```cust.py``` is like the customer who can only view and select the information they want, but cannot make any changes to the database. This program is designed to protect the data and ensure that only authorized individuals can make changes, like a security guard 💂‍♂️.

💾 This project is based on the connectivity between MySQL and Python, so it is essential to make sure that the ```'mysql.connector'``` module is available. If it is not present, you can easily download it using the command ```"pip install mysql-connector"```, like downloading an app 📱.

✅ If all the necessary modules are in place and everything is working perfectly, you should not see any red marks in your Python shell and there should be no error messages in the program. You can sit back, relax, and enjoy the fruits of your hard work! 🎉


Thank You...😃😃
